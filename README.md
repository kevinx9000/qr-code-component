## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

Trying something new is incredibly hard. Things looks so easy when you're watching a lesson or doing a code-along. The reasoning behind decisions, the knowledge of what to change and where, and keeping the variety of options straight seem so simple while watching. But doing is a very different thing. I did not expect this QR Code Challenge to last as long or be as difficult as it was for me.

Starting out is hard! 

### Continued development

Continue watching more videos and lessons at this point.

### Useful resources

This is the course I recently completed that at least got me this far.
